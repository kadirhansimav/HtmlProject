            <p id="aboutContext">Kırmızı Reçete started its musical adventure by releasing their first song ‘Koliba' in September of 2019 in line with the band's vocalist Kadirhan Simav and guitarist Deniz Can Baş's wishes to make their own music, along with taking acoustic stages for the first time in the summer of 2019. Then Buğra Inal (bass guitar) and Yiğit Kantarcı (drums), who had been working together in the past in order to improve, expand the band's musical sense and enrich their musical styles, joined the band. In line with their predisposition to different styles, they began to synthesize these differences in a common denominator in the pieces they had just produced. 'Ölmeli Zaman', which the band revealed shortly after starting work, was shared in June 2020. In addition, the Kırmızı Reçete considers it closer to them to work in different styles in the direction they feel, rather than adhering to a fixed style or sensation in a musical sense.</p>
